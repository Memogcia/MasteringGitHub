Right now this file looks kind of empty...
This comment is outdated^^

Now this file has something, why? because I'm editing this file on the GitHub web interface.
So all the stuff below is going to be stuff, stuff and more stuff, I'll have to delete a file later on...
But I like this file!!!!!!

I shall make another file, so that this one will be able to survive the next commit, long live to the random txt!!!!
